    <p id="p1"> Welcome to my website!  My name is JeaShé Sherpell. I am a 16-year-old girl from Prosper, Texas, with a purpose and timeless passion to create the uncreated! I love integrating science with technology.  One of my biggest goals in life is to invent cures that will further advance the medical field.  I want to go from success to significance and do my best to share my achievements with the world to make it a better place. My hobbies include medical research, specifically oncology.  I also enjoy sports.  I played basketball from when I was five years old to my freshman year.  I now play B.J.J. (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu).  I enjoy working on personal projects (like this website) and DIY-ing.</p>

    <p id= "p3".> You can access all of my projects on my portfolio page!</p>

    

     <p id="p2"> WORK HARD! STAY CURIOUS! STAY  POSITIVE!</p>
